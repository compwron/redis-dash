<h1>Redis documentation</h1>

<h2>Clients</h2>

<p>All clients are listed in the <code>clients.json</code> file. Each key in the JSON
object represents a single client library. For example:</p>

<pre><code>"Rediska": {

  # A programming language should be specified.
  "language": "PHP",

  # If the project has a website of its own, put it here.
  # Otherwise, lose the "url" key.
  "url": "http://rediska.geometria-lab.net",

  # A URL pointing to the repository where users can
  # find the code.
  "repository": "http://github.com/Shumkov/Rediska",

  # A short, free-text description of the client.
  # Should be objective. The goal is to help users
  # choose the correct client they need.
  "description": "A PHP client",

  # An array of Twitter usernames for the authors
  # and maintainers of the library.
  "authors": ["shumkov"]

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Redis commands are described in the <code>commands.json</code> file.</p>

<p>For each command there's a Markdown file with a complete, human-readable
description. We process this Markdown to provide a better experience, so
some things to take into account:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inside text, all commands should be written in all caps, in between
backticks. For example: <code><code>INCR</code></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use some magic keywords to name common elements in Redis. For
example: <code>@multi-bulk-reply</code>. These keywords will get expanded and
auto-linked to relevant parts of the documentation.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There should be at least two predefined sections: description and
return value. The return value section is marked using the @return
keyword:</p>

<pre><code>Returns all keys matching the given pattern.

@return

@multi-bulk-reply: all the keys that matched the pattern.
</code></pre>

<h2>Styling guidelines</h2>

<p>Please wrap your text to 80 characters. You can easily accomplish this
using a CLI tool called <code>par</code>.</p>

<h2>Checking your work</h2>

<p>Once you're done, the very least you should do is make sure that all
files compile properly. You can do this by running Rake inside your
working directory.</p>

<pre><code>$ rake parse
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, if you have <a href="http://aspell.net/">Aspell</a> installed, you
can spell check the documentation:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake spellcheck
</code></pre>

<p>Exceptions can be added to <code>./wordlist</code>.</p>
