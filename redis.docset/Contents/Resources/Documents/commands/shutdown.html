<p>The command behavior is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop all the clients.</li>
<li>Perform a blocking SAVE if at least one <strong>save point</strong> is configured.</li>
<li>Flush the Append Only File if AOF is enabled.</li>
<li>Quit the server.</li>
</ul>


<p>If persistence is enabled this commands makes sure that Redis is switched
off without the lost of any data. This is not guaranteed if the client uses
simply <code>SAVE</code> and then <code>QUIT</code> because other clients may alter the DB data
between the two commands.</p>

<p>Note: A Redis instance that is configured for not persisting on disk
(no AOF configured, nor "save" directive) will not dump the RDB file on
<code>SHUTDOWN</code>, as usually you don't want Redis instances used only for caching
to block on when shutting down.</p>

<h2>SAVE and NOSAVE modifiers</h2>

<p>It is possible to specify an optional modifier to alter the behavior of the command. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SHUTDOWN SAVE</strong> will force a DB saving operation even if no save points are configured.</li>
<li><strong>SHUTDOWN NOSAVE</strong> will prevent a DB saving operation even if one or more save points are configured. (You can think at this variant as an hypothetical <strong>ABORT</strong> command that just stops the server).</li>
</ul>


<p>@return</p>

<p>@status-reply on error. On success nothing is returned since the server
quits and the connection is closed.</p>
