<p>Increments the score of <code>member</code> in the sorted set stored at <code>key</code> by
<code>increment</code>.  If <code>member</code> does not exist in the sorted set, it is added with
<code>increment</code> as its score (as if its previous score was <code>0.0</code>).  If <code>key</code> does
not exist, a new sorted set with the specified <code>member</code> as its sole member is
created.</p>

<p>An error is returned when <code>key</code> exists but does not hold a sorted set.</p>

<p>The <code>score</code> value should be the string representation of a numeric value, and
accepts double precision floating point numbers. It is possible to provide a
negative value to decrement the score.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@bulk-reply: the new score of <code>member</code> (a double precision floating point
number), represented as string.</p>
