received by the Redis server. is very handy in order to understand
what is happening into the database. This command is used directly
via telnet.</p>

<p>The ability to see all the requests processed by the server is useful in order
to spot bugs in the application both when using Redis as a database and as
a distributed caching system.</p>

<p>In order to end a monitoring session just issue a <code>QUIT</code> command by hand.</p>

<p>@return</p>

flow.</p>
