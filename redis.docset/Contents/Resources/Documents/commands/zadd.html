<p>Adds all the specified members with the specified scores to the sorted set stored at <code>key</code>. It is possible to specify multiple score/member pairs.
If a specified member is already a member of the sorted set, the score is updated and the element reinserted at the right position to ensure the correct ordering.  If <code>key</code> does not exist, a new sorted set with the specified members as sole
members is created, like if the sorted set was empty.
If the key exists but does not hold a sorted set, an error is returned.</p>

<p>The score values should be the string representation of a numeric value, and
accepts double precision floating point numbers.</p>

<p>For an introduction to sorted sets, see the data types page on <a href="/topics/data-types#sorted-sets">sorted
sets</a>.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of elements added to the sorted sets, not including elements already existing for which the score was updated.</li>
</ul>


<p>@history</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&gt;= 2.4</code>: Accepts multiple elements. In Redis versions older than 2.4 it was possible to add or update a single member per call.</li>
</ul>
