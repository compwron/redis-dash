<p>The <code>INFO</code> command returns information and statistics about the server
in a format that is simple to parse by computers and easy to read by humans.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@bulk-reply: in the following format (compacted for brevity):</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>used_memory</code> is the total number of bytes allocated by Redis using its
allocator (either standard <code>libc</code> <code>malloc</code>, or an alternative allocator such as
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools/"><code>tcmalloc</code></a></p></li>
<li><p><code>used_memory_rss</code> is the number of bytes that Redis allocated as seen by the
operating system. Optimally, this number is close to <code>used_memory</code> and there
is little memory fragmentation. This is the number reported by tools such as
<code>top</code> and <code>ps</code>. A large difference between these numbers means there is
memory fragmentation. Because Redis does not have control over how its
allocations are mapped to memory pages, <code>used_memory_rss</code> is often the result
of a spike in memory usage. The ratio between <code>used_memory_rss</code> and
<code>used_memory</code> is given as <code>mem_fragmentation_ratio</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>changes_since_last_save</code> refers to the number of operations that produced
some kind of change in the dataset since the last time either <code>SAVE</code> or
<code>BGSAVE</code> was called.</p></li>
<li><p><code>allocation_stats</code> holds a histogram containing the number of allocations of
a certain size (up to 256). This provides a means of introspection for the
type of allocations performed by Redis at run time.</p></li>
