<TITLE>Redis: SETBIT</TITLE>
<p>Sets or clears the bit at <em>offset</em> in the string value stored at <em>key</em>.</p>

<p>The bit is either set or cleared depending on <em>value</em>, which can be either 0 or
1. When <em>key</em> does not exist, a new string value is created. The string is
grown to make sure it can hold a bit at <em>offset</em>. The <em>offset</em> argument is
required to be greater than or equal to 0, and smaller than 2<sup>32</sup> (this
limits bitmaps to 512MB). When the string at <em>key</em> is grown, added
bits are set to 0.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: When setting the last possible bit (<em>offset</em> equal to 2<sup>32</sup> -1) and
the string value stored at <em>key</em> does not yet hold a string value, or holds a
small string value, Redis needs to allocate all intermediate memory which can
block the server for some time.  On a 2010 MacBook Pro, setting bit number
2<sup>32</sup> -1 (512MB allocation) takes ~300ms, setting bit number 2<sup>30</sup> -1 (128MB
allocation) takes ~80ms, setting bit number 2<sup>28</sup> -1 (32MB allocation) takes
~30ms and setting bit number 2<sup>26</sup> -1 (8MB allocation) takes ~8ms.  Note that
once this first allocation is done, subsequent calls to <code>SETBIT</code> for the same
<em>key</em> will not have the allocation overhead.</p>
