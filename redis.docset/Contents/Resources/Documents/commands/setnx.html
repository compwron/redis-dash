<p>Set <code>key</code> to hold string <code>value</code> if <code>key</code> does not exist.
In that case, it is equal to <code>SET</code>. When <code>key</code> already holds
a value, no operation is performed.
<code>SETNX</code> is short for "<strong>SET</strong> if <strong>N</strong>ot e<strong>X</strong>ists".</p>

<h2>Design pattern: Locking with <code>!SETNX</code></h2>

<p><code>SETNX</code> can be used as a locking primitive. For example, to acquire
the lock of the key <code>foo</code>, the client could try the following:</p>

<pre><code>SETNX lock.foo &lt;current Unix time + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>SETNX</code> returns <code>1</code> the client acquired the lock, setting the <code>lock.foo</code>
key to the Unix time at which the lock should no longer be considered valid.
The client will later use <code>DEL lock.foo</code> in order to release the lock.</p>

<p>If <code>SETNX</code> returns <code>0</code> the key is already locked by some other client. We can
either return to the caller if it's a non blocking lock, or enter a
loop retrying to hold the lock until we succeed or some kind of timeout
expires.</p>

<h3>Handling deadlocks</h3>

<p>In the above locking algorithm there is a problem: what happens if a client
fails, crashes, or is otherwise not able to release the lock?
It's possible to detect this condition because the lock key contains a
UNIX timestamp. If such a timestamp is equal to the current Unix time the lock
is no longer valid.</p>

<p>When this happens we can't just call <code>DEL</code> against the key to remove the lock
and then try to issue a <code>SETNX</code>, as there is a race condition here, when
multiple clients detected an expired lock and are trying to release it.</p>

<ul>
<li>C1 and C2 read <code>lock.foo</code> to check the timestamp, because they both received
<code>0</code> after executing <code>SETNX</code>, as the lock is still held by C3 that crashed
after holding the lock.</li>
<li>C1 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code></li>
<li>C1 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li>
<li>C2 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code></li>
<li>C2 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li>
<li><strong>ERROR</strong>: both C1 and C2 acquired the lock because of the race condition.</li>
</ul>


<p>Fortunately, it's possible to avoid this issue using the following algorithm.
Let's see how C4, our sane client, uses the good algorithm:</p>

<ul>
<li>C4 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> in order to acquire the lock</li>
<li>The crashed client C3 still holds it, so Redis will reply with <code>0</code> to C4.</li>
<li>C4 sends <code>GET lock.foo</code> to check if the lock expired. If it is not, it will
sleep for some time and retry from the start.</li>
<li><p>Instead, if the lock is expired because the Unix time at <code>lock.foo</code> is older
than the current Unix time, C4 tries to perform:</p>

<pre><code>GETSET lock.foo &lt;current Unix timestamp + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Because of the <code>GETSET</code> semantic, C4 can check if the old value stored
at <code>key</code> is still an expired timestamp. If it is, the lock was acquired.</p></li>
<li>If another client, for instance C5, was faster than C4 and acquired
the lock with the <code>GETSET</code> operation, the C4 <code>GETSET</code> operation will return a non
expired timestamp. C4 will simply restart from the first step. Note that even
if C4 set the key a bit a few seconds in the future this is not a problem.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Important note</strong>: In order to make this locking algorithm more robust, a client
holding a lock should always check the timeout didn't expire before unlocking
the key with <code>DEL</code> because client failures can be complex, not just crashing
but also blocking a lot of time against some operations and trying to issue
<code>DEL</code> after a lot of time (when the LOCK is already held by another client).</p>
