<TITLE>Redis: BITOP</TITLE>
<p>Perform a bitwise operation between multiple keys (containing string
values) and store the result in the destionation key.</p>

<p>The <code>BITOP</code> command supports four bitwise operations: <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>XOR</strong> and <strong>NOT</strong>, thus the valid forms to call the command are:</p>

<ul>
<li>BITOP AND <em>destkey srckey1 srckey2 srckey3 ... srckeyN</em></li>
<li>BITOP OR <em>destkey srckey1 srckey2 srckey3 ... srckeyN</em></li>
<li>BITOP XOR <em>destkey srckey1 srckey2 srckey3 ... srckeyN</em></li>
<li>BITOP NOT <em>destkey srckey</em></li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see <strong>NOT</strong> is special as it only takes an input key, because it
performs invertion of bits so it only makes sense as an unary operator.</p>

<p>The result of the operation is always stored at <em>destkey</em>.</p>

<h2>Handling of strings with different lengths</h2>

<p>When an operation is performed between strings having different lengths, all
the strings shorter than the longest string in the set are treated as if
they were zero-padded up to the length of the longest string.</p>

<p>The same holds true for non-existing keys, that are considered as a stream of
zero bytes up to the length of the longest string.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply</p>

<p>The size of the string stored into the destination key, that is equal to the size of the longest input string.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SET key1 "foobar"
SET key2 "abcdef"
BITOP AND dest key1 key2
GET dest
</code></pre>

<h2>Pattern: real time metrics using bitmaps</h2>

<p><code>BITOP</code> is a good complement to the pattern documented in the <code>BITCOUNT</code> command documentation. Different bitmaps can be combined in order to obtain a target
bitmap where to perform the population counting operation.</p>

<p>See the article <a href="http://blog.getspool.com/2011/11/29/fast-easy-realtime-metrics-using-redis-bitmaps/">Fast easy realtime metrics usign Redis bitmaps</a> for an interesting use cases.</p>

<h2>Performance considerations</h2>

<p><code>BITOP</code> is a potentially slow command as it runs in O(N) time.
Care should be taken when running it against long input strings.</p>

<p>For real time metrics and statistics involving large inputs a good approach
is to use a slave (with read-only option disabled) where to perform the
bit-wise operations without blocking the master instance.</p>
