<p>Returns all fields and values of the hash stored at <code>key</code>. In the returned
value, every field name is followed by its value, so the length
of the reply is twice the size of the hash.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@multi-bulk-reply: list of fields and their values stored in the hash, or an
empty list when <code>key</code> does not exist.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
HSET myhash field1 "Hello"
HSET myhash field2 "World"
HGETALL myhash
</code></pre>
