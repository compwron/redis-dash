<p>Overwrites part of the string stored at <em>key</em>, starting at the specified
offset, for the entire length of <em>value</em>. If the offset is larger than the
current length of the string at <em>key</em>, the string is padded with zero-bytes to
make <em>offset</em> fit. Non-existing keys are considered as empty strings, so this
command will make sure it holds a string large enough to be able to set <em>value</em>
at <em>offset</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the maximum offset that you can set is 2<sup>29</sup> -1 (536870911), as Redis
Strings are limited to 512 megabytes. If you need to grow beyond this size, you
can use multiple keys.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: When setting the last possible byte and the string value stored at
<em>key</em> does not yet hold a string value, or holds a small string value, Redis
needs to allocate all intermediate memory which can block the server for some
time.  On a 2010 MacBook Pro, setting byte number 536870911 (512MB allocation)
takes ~300ms, setting byte number 134217728 (128MB allocation) takes ~80ms,
setting bit number 33554432 (32MB allocation) takes ~30ms and setting bit
number 8388608 (8MB allocation) takes ~8ms. Note that once this first
allocation is done, subsequent calls to <code>SETRANGE</code> for the same <em>key</em> will not
have the allocation overhead.</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<p>Thanks to <code>SETRANGE</code> and the analogous <code>GETRANGE</code> commands, you can use Redis strings
as a linear array with O(1) random access. This is a very fast and
efficient storage in many real world use cases.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply: the length of the string after it was modified by the command.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<p>Basic usage:</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SET key1 "Hello World"
SETRANGE key1 6 "Redis"
GET key1
</code></pre>

<p>Example of zero padding:</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SETRANGE key2 6 "Redis"
GET key2
</code></pre>
