<p>Computes the intersection of <code>numkeys</code> sorted sets given by the specified keys,
and stores the result in <code>destination</code>. It is mandatory to provide the number
of input keys (<code>numkeys</code>) before passing the input keys and the other
(optional) arguments.</p>

<p>By default, the resulting score of an element is the sum of its scores in the
sorted sets where it exists. Because intersection requires an element
to be a member of every given sorted set, this results in the score of every
element in the resulting sorted set to be equal to the number of input sorted sets.</p>

<p>For a description of the <code>WEIGHTS</code> and <code>AGGREGATE</code> options, see <code>ZUNIONSTORE</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>destination</code> already exists, it is overwritten.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply: the number of elements in the resulting sorted set at
<code>destination</code>.</p>
