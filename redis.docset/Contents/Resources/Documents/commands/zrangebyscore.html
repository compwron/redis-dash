<p>Returns all the elements in the sorted set at <code>key</code> with a score between <code>min</code>
and <code>max</code> (including elements with score equal to <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>). The
elements are considered to be ordered from low to high scores.</p>

<p>The elements having the same score are returned in lexicographical order (this
follows from a property of the sorted set implementation in Redis and does not
involve further computation).</p>

<p>The optional <code>LIMIT</code> argument can be used to only get a range of the matching
elements (similar to <em>SELECT LIMIT offset, count</em> in SQL). Keep in mind that if
<code>offset</code> is large, the sorted set needs to be traversed for <code>offset</code> elements
before getting to the elements to return, which can add up to O(N) time
complexity.</p>

<p>The optional <code>WITHSCORES</code> argument makes the command return both the element
and its score, instead of the element alone. This option is available since
Redis 2.0.</p>

<h2>Exclusive intervals and infinity</h2>

<p><code>min</code> and <code>max</code> can be <code>-inf</code> and <code>+inf</code>, so that you are not required to know
the highest or lowest score in the sorted set to get all elements from or up to
a certain score.</p>

<p>By default, the interval specified by <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is closed (inclusive).
It is possible to specify an open interval (exclusive) by prefixing the score
with the character <code>(</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (1 5
</code></pre>

<p>Will return all elements with <code>1 &lt; score &lt;= 5</code> while:</p>

<pre><code>ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (5 (10
</code></pre>

<p>Will return all the elements with <code>5 &lt; score &lt; 10</code> (5 and 10 excluded).</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@multi-bulk-reply: list of elements in the specified score range (optionally with
their scores).</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
ZADD myzset 1 "one"
ZADD myzset 2 "two"
ZADD myzset 3 "three"
ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset -inf +inf
ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset 1 2
ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset (1 2
ZRANGEBYSCORE myzset (1 (2
