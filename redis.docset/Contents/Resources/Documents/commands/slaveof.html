<p>The <code>SLAVEOF</code> command can change the replication settings of a slave on the fly.
If a Redis server is already acting as slave, the command <code>SLAVEOF</code> NO ONE
will turn off the replication, turning the Redis server into a MASTER.
In the proper form <code>SLAVEOF</code> hostname port will make the server a slave of another
server listening at the specified hostname and port.</p>

<p>If a server is already a slave of some master, <code>SLAVEOF</code> hostname port will
stop the replication against the old server and start the synchronization
against the new one, discarding the old dataset.</p>

<p>The form <code>SLAVEOF</code> NO ONE will stop replication, turning the server into a
MASTER, but will not discard the replication. So, if the old master stops working,
it is possible to turn the slave into a master and set the application to
use this new master in read/write. Later when the other Redis server is
fixed, it can be reconfigured to work as a slave.</p>
