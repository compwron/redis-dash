<p>Atomically returns and removes the last element (tail) of the list stored at
<code>source</code>, and pushes the element at the first element (head) of the list stored
at <code>destination</code>.</p>

<p>For example: consider <code>source</code> holding the list <code>a,b,c</code>, and <code>destination</code>
holding the list <code>x,y,z</code>. Executing <code>RPOPLPUSH</code> results in <code>source</code> holding
<code>a,b</code> and <code>destination</code> holding <code>c,x,y,z</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>source</code> does not exist, the value <code>nil</code> is returned and no operation is
performed. If <code>source</code> and <code>destination</code> are the same, the operation is
equivalent to removing the last element from the list and pushing it as first
element of the list, so it can be considered as a list rotation command.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@bulk-reply: the element being popped and pushed.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
RPUSH mylist "one"
RPUSH mylist "two"
RPUSH mylist "three"
RPOPLPUSH mylist myotherlist
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
LRANGE myotherlist 0 -1
</code></pre>

<h2>Pattern: Reliable queue</h2>

<p>Redis is often used as a messaging server to implement processing of
background jobs or other kinds of messaging tasks. A simple form of queue
is often obtained pushing values into a list in the producer side, and
waiting for this values in the consumer side using <code>RPOP</code>
(using polling), or <code>BRPOP</code> if the client is better served
by a blocking operation.</p>

<p>However in this context the obtained queue is not <em>reliable</em> as messages can
be lost, for example in the case there is a network problem or if the consumer
crashes just after the message is received but it is still to process.</p>

<p><code>RPOPLPUSH</code> (or <code>BRPOPLPUSH</code> for the blocking variant)
offers a way to avoid this problem: the consumer fetches the message and
at the same time pushes it into a <em>processing</em> list. It will use the
<code>LREM</code> command in order to remove the message from the
<em>processing</em> list once the message has been processed.</p>

<p>An additional client may monitor the <em>processing</em> list for items that remain
there for too much time, and will push those timed out items into the queue
again if needed.</p>

<h2>Pattern: Circular list</h2>

<p>Using <code>RPOPLPUSH</code> with the same source and destination key, a client can
visit all the elements of an N-elements list, one after the other, in O(N)
without transferring the full list from the server to the client using a single
<code>LRANGE</code> operation.</p>

<p>The above pattern works even if the following two conditions:
* There are multiple clients rotating the list: they'll fetch different elements, until all the elements of the list are visited, and the process restarts.
* Even if other clients are actively pushing new items at the end of the list.</p>

<p>The above makes it very simple to implement a system where a set of items must be processed by N workers continuously as fast as possible. An example is a monitoring system that must check that a set of web sites are reachable, with the smallest delay possible, using a number of parallel workers.</p>

<p>Note that this implementation of workers is trivially scalable and reliable, because even if a message is lost the item is still in the queue and will be processed at the next iteration.</p>
