<p>Kills the currently executing Lua script, assuming no write operation was yet performed by the script.</p>

<p>This command is mainly useful to kill a script that is running for too much time(for instance because it entered an infinite loop because of a bug).
The script will be killed and the client currently blocked into EVAL will see the command returning with an error.</p>

<p>If the script already performed write operations it can not be killed in this way because it would violate Lua script atomicity contract. In such a case only <code>SHUTDOWN NOSAVE</code> is able to kill the script, killign the Redis process in an hard way preventing it to persist with half-written informations.</p>

<p>Plase check the <code>EVAL</code> page for detailed information about how Redis Lua scripting works.</p>
