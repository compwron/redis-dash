<p>Instruct Redis to start an <a href="/topics/persistence#append-only-file">Append Only File</a> rewrite process. The rewrite will create a small optimized version of the current Append Only File.</p>

<p>If <code>BGREWRITEAOF</code> fails, no data gets lost as the old AOF will be untouched.</p>

<p>The rewrite will be only triggered by Redis if there is not already a background process doing persistence. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a Redis child is creating a snapshot on disk, the AOF rewrite is <em>scheduled</em> but not started until the saving child producing the RDB file terminates. In this case the <code>BGREWRITEAOF</code> will still return an OK code, but with an appropriate message. You can check if an AOF rewrite is scheduled looking at the <code>INFO</code> command starting from Redis 2.6.</li>
<li>If an AOF rewrite is already in progress the command returns an error and no AOF rewrite will be scheduled for a later time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since Redis 2.4 the AOF rewrite is automatically triggered by Redis, however the <code>BGREWRITEAOF</code> command can be used to trigger a rewrite at any time.</p>

<p>Please check the documentation about <a href="/topics/persistence#append-only-file">Redis Persistence</a> for more information.</p>
