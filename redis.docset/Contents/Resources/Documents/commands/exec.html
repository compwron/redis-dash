<TITLE>Redis: EXEC</TITLE>
<p>Executes all previously queued commands in a
<a href="../topics/transactions.html">transaction</a> and restores the connection state to
normal.</p>

<p>When using <code>WATCH</code>, <code>EXEC</code> will execute commands only if the
watched keys were not modified, allowing for a <a href="../topics/transactions.html#cas">check-and-set
mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@multi-bulk-reply: each element being the reply to each of the commands
in the atomic transaction.</p>

<p>When using <code>WATCH</code>, <code>EXEC</code> can return a @nil-reply if the execution was
aborted.</p>
