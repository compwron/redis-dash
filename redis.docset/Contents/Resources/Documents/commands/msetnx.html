<p>Sets the given keys to their respective values. <code>MSETNX</code> will not perform any
operation at all even if just a single key already exists.</p>

<p>Because of this semantic <code>MSETNX</code> can be used in order to set different keys
representing different fields of an unique logic object in a way that
ensures that either all the fields or none at all are set.</p>

<p><code>MSETNX</code> is atomic, so all given keys are set at once. It is not possible for
clients to see that some of the keys were updated while others are unchanged.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1</code> if the all the keys were set.</li>
<li><code>0</code> if no key was set (at least one key already existed).</li>
</ul>


<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
MSETNX key1 "Hello" key2 "there"
MSETNX key2 "there" key3 "world"
MGET key1 key2 key3
</code></pre>
