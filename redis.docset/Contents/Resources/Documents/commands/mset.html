<p>Sets the given keys to their respective values. <code>MSET</code> replaces existing values
with new values, just as regular <code>SET</code>.  See <code>MSETNX</code> if you don't want to
overwrite existing values.</p>

<p><code>MSET</code> is atomic, so all given keys are set at once. It is not possible for
clients to see that some of the keys were updated while others are unchanged.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@status-reply: always <code>OK</code> since <code>MSET</code> can't fail.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
MSET key1 "Hello" key2 "World"
GET key1
GET key2
</code></pre>
