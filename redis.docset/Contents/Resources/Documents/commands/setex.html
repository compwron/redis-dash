<p>Set <code>key</code> to hold the string <code>value</code> and set <code>key</code> to timeout after a given
number of seconds.  This command is equivalent to executing the following
commands:</p>

<pre><code>SET mykey value
EXPIRE mykey seconds
</code></pre>

<p><code>SETEX</code> is atomic, and can be reproduced by using the previous two commands
inside an <code>MULTI</code>/<code>EXEC</code> block. It is provided as a faster alternative to the
given sequence of operations, because this operation is very common when Redis
is used as a cache.</p>

<p>An error is returned when <code>seconds</code> is invalid.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@status-reply</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SETEX mykey 10 "Hello"
TTL mykey
GET mykey
</code></pre>
