<p><code>BRPOP</code> is a blocking list pop primitive.  It is the blocking version of
<code>RPOP</code> because it blocks the connection when there are no
elements to pop from any of the given lists. An element is popped from the
tail of the first list that is non-empty, with the given keys being checked
in the order that they are given.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/commands/blpop">BLPOP documentation</a> for the exact semantics, since
<code>BRPOP</code> is identical to <code>BLPOP</code> with the only difference
being that it pops elements from the tail of a list instead of popping from the
head.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@multi-bulk-reply: specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>nil</code> multi-bulk when no element could be popped and the timeout expired.</li>
<li>A two-element multi-bulk with the first element being the name of the key where an element
was popped and the second element being the value of the popped element.</li>
</ul>


<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>redis&gt; DEL list1 list2
(integer) 0
redis&gt; RPUSH list1 a b c
(integer) 3
redis&gt; BRPOP list1 list2 0
1) "list1"
2) "c"
</code></pre>
