<p>If <code>key</code> already exists and is a string, this command appends the <code>value</code> at
the end of the string.  If <code>key</code> does not exist it is created and set as an
empty string, so <code>APPEND</code> will be similar to <code>SET</code> in this special case.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply: the length of the string after the append operation.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
EXISTS mykey
APPEND mykey "Hello"
APPEND mykey " World"
GET mykey
</code></pre>

<h2>Pattern: Time series</h2>

<p>the <code>APPEND</code> command can be used to create a very compact representation of
a list of fixed-size samples, usually referred as <em>time series</em>.
Every time a new sample arrives we can store it using the command</p>

<pre><code>APPEND timeseries "fixed-size sample"
</code></pre>

<p>Accessing to individual elements in the time serie is not hard:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>STRLEN</code> can be used in order to obtain the number of samples.</li>
<li><code>GETRANGE</code> allows for random access of elements. If our time series have an associated time information we can easily implement a binary search to get range combining <code>GETRANGE</code> with the Lua scripting engine available in Redis 2.6.</li>
<li><code>SETRANGE</code> can be used to overwrite an existing time serie.</li>
</ul>


<p>The limitations of this pattern is that we are forced into an append-only mode of operation, there is no way to cut the time series to a given size easily because Redis currently lacks a command able to trim string objects. However the space efficiency of time series stored in this way is remarkable.</p>

<p>Hint: it is possible to switch to a different key based on the current unix time, in this way it is possible to have just a relatively small amount of samples per key, to avoid dealing with very big keys, and to make this pattern more
firendly to be distributed across many Redis instances.</p>

<p>An example sampling the temperature of a sensor using fixed-size strings (using a binary format is better in real implementations).</p>

<pre><code>@cli
APPEND ts "0043"
APPEND ts "0035"
GETRANGE ts 0 3
GETRANGE ts 4 7
</code></pre>
