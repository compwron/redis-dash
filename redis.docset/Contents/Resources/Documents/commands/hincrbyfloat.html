<p>Increment the specified <code>field</code> of an hash stored at <code>key</code>, and representing a floating point number, by the specified <code>increment</code>.  If the field does not exist, it is set to <code>0</code> before performing the operation. An error is returned if one of the following conditions occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>The field contains a value of the wrong type (not a string).</li>
<li>The current field content or the specified increment are not parsable as a double precision floating point number.</li>
</ul>


<p>The exact behavior of this command is identical to the one of the <code>INCRBYFLOAT</code> command, please refer to the documentation of <code>INCRBYFLOAT</code> for further information.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@bulk-reply: the value of <code>field</code> after the increment.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
HSET mykey field 10.50
HINCRBYFLOAT mykey field 0.1
HSET mykey field 5.0e3
HINCRBYFLOAT mykey field 2.0e2
</code></pre>

<h2>Implementation details</h2>

<p>The command is always propagated in the replication link and the Append Only File as a <code>HSET</code> operation, so that differences in the underlying floating point
math implementation will not be sources of inconsistency.</p>
