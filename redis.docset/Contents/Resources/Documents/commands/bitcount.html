<TITLE>Redis: BITCOUNT</TITLE>
<p>Count the number of set bits (population counting) in a string.</p>

<p>By default all the bytes contained in the string are examined. It is possible
to specifiy the counting operation only in an interval passing the additional
arguments <em>start</em> and <em>end</em>.</p>

<p>Like for the <code>GETRANGE</code> command start and end can contain negative values
in order to index bytes starting from the end of the string, where -1 is the
last byte, -2 is the penultimate, and so forth.</p>

<p>Non existing keys are treated as empty strings, so the command will return
zero.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@integer-reply</p>

<p>The number of bits set to 1.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SET mykey "foobar"
BITCOUNT mykey
BITCOUNT mykey 0 0
BITCOUNT mykey 1 1
</code></pre>

<h2>Pattern: real time metrics using bitmaps</h2>

<p>Bitmaps are a very space efficient representation of certain kinds of
information. One example is a web application that needs the history
of user visits, so that for instance it is possible to determine what
users are good targets of beta features, or for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Using the <code>SETBIT</code> command this is trivial to accomplish, identifying every
day with a small progressive integer. For instance day 0 is the first day
the application was put online, day 1 the next day, and so forth.</p>

<p>Every time an user performs a page view, the application can register that
in the current day the user visited the web site using the <code>SETBIT</code> command
setting the bit corresponding to the current day.</p>

<p>Later it will be trivial to know the number of single days the user visited
the web site simply calling the <code>BITCOUNT</code> command against the bitmap.</p>

<p>A similar pattern where user IDs are used instead of days is described
in the article <a href="http://blog.getspool.com/2011/11/29/fast-easy-realtime-metrics-using-redis-bitmaps/">Fast easy realtime metrics usign Redis bitmaps</a>.</p>

<h2>Performance considerations</h2>

<p>In the above example of counting days, even after 10 years the application
is online we still have just <code>365*10</code> bits of data per user, that is
just 456 bytes per user. With this amount of data <code>BITCOUNT</code> is still as fast
as any other O(1) Redis command like <code>GET</code> or <code>INCR</code>.</p>

<p>When the bitmap is big, there are two alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking a separated key that is incremented every time the bitmap is modified. This can be very efficient and atomic using a small Redis Lua script.</li>
<li>Running the bitmap incrementally using the <code>BITCOUNT</code> <em>start</em> and <em>end</em> optional parameters, accumulating the results client-side, and optionally caching the result into a key.</li>
</ul>
