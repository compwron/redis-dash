<p>Request for authentication in a password protected Redis server.
Redis can be instructed to require a password before allowing clients
to execute commands. This is done using the <code>requirepass</code> directive in the
configuration file.</p>

<p>If <code>password</code> matches the password in the configuration file, the server replies with
the <code>OK</code> status code and starts accepting commands.
Otherwise, an error is returned and the clients needs to try a new password.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: because of the high performance nature of Redis, it is possible to try
a lot of passwords in parallel in very short time, so make sure to generate
a strong and very long password so that this attack is infeasible.</p>
