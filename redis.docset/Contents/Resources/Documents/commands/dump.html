<p>Serialize the value stored at key in a Redis-specific format and return it to the user. The returned value can be synthesized back into a Redis key using the <code>RESTORE</code> command.</p>

<p>The serialization format is opaque and non-standard, however it has a few semantical characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>It contains a 64bit checksum that is used to make sure errors will be detected. The <code>RESTORE</code> command makes sure to check the checksum before synthesizing a key using the serialized value.</li>
<li>Values are encoded in the same format used by RDB.</li>
<li>An RDB version is encoded inside the serialized value, so that different Redis versions with incompatible RDB formats will refuse to process the serialized value.</li>
</ul>


<p>The serialized value does NOT contain expire information. In order to capture the time to live of the current value the <code>PTTL</code> command should be used.</p>

<p>If <code>key</code> does not exist a nil bulk reply is returned.</p>

<p>@return</p>

<p>@bulk-reply: the serialized value.</p>

<p>@examples</p>

<pre><code>@cli
SET mykey 10
DUMP mykey
</code></pre>
