<h1>Introduction to Redis</h1>

<p>Redis is an open source, advanced <strong>key-value store</strong>.  It
is often referred to as a <strong>data structure server</strong> since
keys can contain <a href="/topics/data-types#strings">strings</a>,
<a href="/topics/data-types#hashes">hashes</a>, <a href="/topics/data-types#lists">lists</a>,
<a href="/topics/data-types#sets">sets</a> and <a href="/topics/data-types#sorted-sets">sorted
sets</a>.</p>

<p>You can run <strong>atomic operations</strong>
on these types, like <a href="/commands/append">appending to a string</a>;
<a href="/commands/hincrby">incrementing the value in a hash</a>; <a href="/commands/lpush">pushing to a
list</a>; <a href="/commands/sinter">computing set intersection</a>,
<a href="/commands/sunion">union</a> and <a href="/commands/sdiff">difference</a>;
or <a href="/commands/zrangebyscore">getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted
set</a>.</p>

<p>In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
<strong>in-memory dataset</strong>. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by <a href="/topics/persistence#snapshotting">dumping the dataset to disk</a>
every once in a while, or by <a href="/topics/persistence#append-only-file">appending each command to a
log</a>.</p>

<p>Redis also supports trivial-to-setup <a href="/topics/replication">master-slave
replication</a>, with very fast non-blocking first
synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split and so forth.</p>

<p>Other features include a simple <a href="/topics/transactions">check-and-set
mechanism</a>, <a href="/topics/pubsub">pub/sub</a>
and configuration settings to make Redis behave like a
cache.</p>

<p>You can use Redis from <a href="/clients">most programming languages</a> out there.</p>

<p>Redis is written in <strong>ANSI C</strong> and works in most POSIX systems like Linux,
*BSD, OS X without external dependencies. Linux and OSX are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and more tested, and we <strong>recommend using Linux for deploying</strong>. Redis may work in Solaris-derived systems like SmartOS, but the support is <em>best effort</em>. There
is no official support for Windows builds, although you may
have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=34">some</a>
<a href="https://github.com/dmajkic/redis">options</a>.</p>
