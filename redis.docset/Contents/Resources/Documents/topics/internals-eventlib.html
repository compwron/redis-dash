<h1>Event Library</h1>

<h2>Why is an Event Library needed at all?</h2>

<p>Let us figure it out through a series of Q&amp;As.</p>

<p>Q: What do you expect a network server to be doing all the time? <br/>
A: Watch for inbound connections on the port its listening and accept them.</p>

<p>Q: Calling <a href="http://man.cx/accept%282%29%20accept">accept</a> yields a descriptor. What do I do with it?<br/>
A: Save the descriptor and do a non-blocking read/write operation on it.</p>

<p>Q: Why does the read/write have to be non-blocking?<br/>
A: If the file operation ( even a socket in Unix is a file ) is blocking how could the server for example accept other connection requests when its blocked in a file I/O operation.</p>

<p>Q: I guess I have to do many such non-blocking operations on the socket to see when it's ready. Am I right?<br/>
A: Yes. That is what an event library does for you. Now you get it.</p>

<p>Q: How do Event Libraries do what they do?<br/>
A: They use the operating system's <a href="http://www.devshed.com/c/a/BrainDump/Linux-Files-and-the-Event-Poll-Interface/">polling</a> facility along with timers.</p>

<p>Q: So are there any open source event libraries that do what you just described? <br/>
A: Yes. <code>libevent</code> and <code>libev</code> are two such event libraries that I can recall off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Q: Does Redis use such open source event libraries for handling socket I/O?<br/>
A: No. For various <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/redis-db/browse_thread/thread/b52814e9ef15b8d0/">reasons</a> Redis uses its own event library.</p>
