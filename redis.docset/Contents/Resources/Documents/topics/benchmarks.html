<h1>How fast is Redis?</h1>

<p>Redis includes the <code>redis-benchmark</code> utility that simulates SETs/GETs done by N
clients at the same time sending M total queries (it is similar to the Apache's
<code>ab</code> utility). Below you'll find the full output of a benchmark executed
against a Linux box.</p>

<p>The following options are supported:</p>

<pre><code>Usage: redis-benchmark [-h &lt;host&gt;] [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-c &lt;clients&gt;] [-n &lt;requests]&gt; [-k &lt;boolean&gt;]

 -h &lt;hostname&gt;      Server hostname (default 127.0.0.1)
 -p &lt;port&gt;          Server port (default 6379)
 -s &lt;socket&gt;        Server socket (overrides host and port)
 -c &lt;clients&gt;       Number of parallel connections (default 50)
 -n &lt;requests&gt;      Total number of requests (default 10000)
 -d &lt;size&gt;          Data size of SET/GET value in bytes (default 2)
 -k &lt;boolean&gt;       1=keep alive 0=reconnect (default 1)
 -r &lt;keyspacelen&gt;   Use random keys for SET/GET/INCR, random values for SADD
  Using this option the benchmark will get/set keys
  in the form mykey_rand000000012456 instead of constant
  keys, the &lt;keyspacelen&gt; argument determines the max
  number of values for the random number. For instance
  if set to 10 only rand000000000000 - rand000000000009
  range will be allowed.
 -q                 Quiet. Just show query/sec values
 -l                 Loop. Run the tests forever
 -I                 Idle mode. Just open N idle connections and wait.
</code></pre>

<p>You need to have a running Redis instance before launching the benchmark.
A typical example would be:</p>

<pre><code>redis-benchmark -q -n 100000
</code></pre>

<p>Using this tool is quite easy, and you can also write your own benchmark,
but as with any benchmarking activity, there are some pitfalls to avoid.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls and misconceptions</h2>

<p>The first point is obvious: the golden rule of a useful benchmark is to
only compare apples and apples. Different versions of Redis can be compared
on the same workload for instance. Or the same version of Redis, but with
different options. If you plan to compare Redis to something else, then it is
important to evaluate the functional and technical differences, and take them
in account.</p>

<ul>
<li>Redis is a server: all commands involve network or IPC roundtrips. It is
meaningless to compare it to embedded data stores such as SQLite, Berkeley DB,
Tokyo/Kyoto Cabinet, etc ... because the cost of most operations is precisely
dominated by network/protocol management.</li>
<li>Redis commands return an acknowledgment for all usual commands. Some other
data stores do not (for instance MongoDB does not implicitly acknowledge write
operations). Comparing Redis to stores involving one-way queries is only
mildly useful.</li>
<li>Naively iterating on synchronous Redis commands does not benchmark Redis
itself, but rather measure your network (or IPC) latency. To really test Redis,
you need multiple connections (like redis-benchmark) and/or to use pipelining
to aggregate several commands and/or multiple threads or processes.</li>
<li>Redis is an in-memory data store with some optional persistency options. If
you plan to compare it to transactional servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc ...),
then you should consider activating AOF and decide of a suitable fsync policy.</li>
<li>Redis is a single-threaded server. It is not designed to benefit from
multiple CPU cores. People are supposed to launch several Redis instances to
scale out on several cores if needed. It is not really fair to compare one
single Redis instance to a multi-threaded data store.</li>
</ul>


<p>Then the benchmark should do the same operations, and work in the same way with
the multiple data stores you want to compare. It is absolutely pointless to
compare the result of redis-benchmark to the result of another benchmark
program and extrapolate.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that redis-benchmark is designed to make Redis
performances look stellar, the throughput achieved by redis-benchmark being
somewhat artificial, and not achievable by a real application. This is
actually plain wrong.</p>

<p>The redis-benchmark program is a quick and useful way to get some figures and
evaluate the performance of a Redis instance on a given hardware. However,
it does not represent the maximum throughput a Redis instance can sustain.
Actually, by using pipelining and a fast client (hiredis), it is fairly easy
to write a program generating more throughput than redis-benchmark. The current
version of redis-benchmark achieves throughput by exploiting concurrency only
(i.e. it creates several connections to the server). It does not use pipelining
or any parallelism at all (one pending query per connection at most, and
no multi-threading).</p>

<p>For instance, Redis and memcached in single-threaded mode can be compared on
GET/SET operations. Both are in-memory data stores, working mostly in the same
way at the protocol level. Provided their respective benchmark application is
aggregating queries in the same way (pipelining) and use a similar number of
connections, the comparison is actually meaningful.</p>

<p>This perfect example is illustrated by the dialog between Redis (antirez) and
memcached (dormando) developers.</p>

<p><a href="http://antirez.com/post/redis-memcached-benchmark.html">antirez 1 - On Redis, Memcached, Speed, Benchmarks and The Toilet</a></p>

<p><a href="http://dormando.livejournal.com/525147.html">dormando - Redis VS Memcached (slightly better bench)</a></p>

<p><a href="http://antirez.com/post/update-on-memcached-redis-benchmark.html">antirez 2 - An update on the Memcached/Redis benchmark</a></p>

<p>You can see that in the end, the difference between the two solutions is not
so staggering, once all technical aspects are considered. Please note both
Redis and memcached have been optimized further after these benchmarks ...</p>

<p>Finally, when very efficient servers are benchmarked (and stores like Redis
or memcached definitely fall in this category), it may be difficult to saturate
the server. Sometimes, the performance bottleneck is on client side,
and not server-side. In that case, the client (i.e. the benchmark program itself)
must be fixed, or perhaps scaled out, in order to reach the maximum throughput.</p>

<h2>Factors impacting Redis performance</h2>

<p>There are multiple factors having direct consequences on Redis performance.
We mention them here, since they can alter the result of any benchmarks.
Please note however, that a typical Redis instance running on a low end,
non tuned, box usually provides good enough performance for most applications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Network bandwidth and latency usually have a direct impact on the performance.
It is a good practice to use the ping program to quickly check the latency
between the client and server hosts is normal before launching the benchmark.
Regarding the bandwidth, it is generally useful to estimate
the throughput in Gbits/s and compare it to the theoretical bandwidth
of the network. For instance a benchmark setting 4 KB strings
in Redis at 100000 q/s, would actually consume 3.2 Gbits/s of bandwidth
and probably fit with a 10 GBits/s link, but not a 1 Gbits/s one. In many real
world scenarios, Redis throughput is limited by the network well before being
limited by the CPU. To consolidate several high-throughput Redis instances
on a single server, it worth considering putting a 10 Gbits/s NIC
or multiple 1 Gbits/s NICs with TCP/IP bonding.</li>
<li>CPU is another very important factor. Being single-threaded, Redis favors
fast CPUs with large caches and not many cores. At this game, Intel CPUs are
currently the winners. It is not uncommon to get only half the performance on
an AMD Opteron CPU compared to similar Nehalem EP/Westmere EP/Sandy bridge
Intel CPUs with Redis. When client and server run on the same box, the CPU is
the limiting factor with redis-benchmark.</li>
<li>Speed of RAM and memory bandwidth seem less critical for global performance
especially for small objects. For large objects (>10 KB), it may become
noticeable though. Usually, it is not really cost effective to buy expensive
fast memory modules to optimize Redis.</li>
<li>Redis runs slower on a VM. Virtualization toll is quite high because
for many common operations, Redis does not add much overhead on top of the
required system calls and network interruptions. Prefer to run Redis on a
physical box, especially if you favor deterministic latencies. On a
state-of-the-art hypervisor (VMWare), result of redis-benchmark on a VM
through the physical network is almost divided by 2 compared to the
physical machine, with some significant CPU time spent in system and
interruptions.</li>
<li>When the server and client benchmark programs run on the same box, both
the TCP/IP loopback and unix domain sockets can be used. It depends on the
platform, but unix domain sockets can achieve around 50% more throughput than
the TCP/IP loopback (on Linux for instance). The default behavior of
redis-benchmark is to use the TCP/IP loopback.</li>
<li>On multi CPU sockets servers, Redis performance becomes dependant on the
NUMA configuration and process location. The most visible effect is that
redis-benchmark results seem non deterministic because client and server
processes are distributed randomly on the cores. To get deterministic results,
it is required to use process placement tools (on Linux: taskset or numactl).
The most efficient combination is always to put the client and server on two
different cores of the same CPU to benefit from the L3 cache.
Here are some results of 4 KB SET benchmark for 3 server CPUs (AMD Istanbul,
Intel Nehalem EX, and Intel Westmere) with different relative placements.
Please note this benchmark is not meant to compare CPU models between themselves
(CPUs exact model and frequency are therefore not disclosed).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>With high-end configurations, the number of client connections is also an
important factor. Being based on epoll/kqueue, Redis event loop is quite
scalable. Redis has already been benchmarked at more than 60000 connections,
and was still able to sustain 50000 q/s in these conditions. As a rule of thumb,
an instance with 30000 connections can only process half the throughput
achievable with 100 connections. Here is an example showing the throughput of
a Redis instance per number of connections:</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="https://github.com/dspezia/redis-doc/raw/system_info/topics/Connections_chart.png" alt="connections chart" /></p>

<ul>
<li>With high-end configurations, it is possible to achieve higher throughput by
tuning the NIC(s) configuration and associated interruptions. Best throughput
is achieved by setting an affinity between Rx/Tx NIC queues and CPU cores,
and activating RPS (Receive Packet Steering) support. More information in this
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/gUhc19gnYgc/BruTPCOroiMJ">thread</a>.
Jumbo frames may also provide a performance boost when large objects are used.</li>
<li>Depending on the platform, Redis can be compiled against different memory
allocators (libc malloc, jemalloc, tcmalloc), which may have different behaviors
in term of raw speed, internal and external fragmentation.
If you did not compile Redis by yourself, you can use the INFO command to check
the mem_allocator field. Please note most benchmarks do not run long enough to
generate significant external fragmentation (contrary to production Redis
instances).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other things to consider</h2>

<p>One important goal of any benchmark is to get reproducible results, so they
can be compared to the results of other tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>A good practice is to try to run tests on isolated hardware as far as possible.
If it is not possible, then the system must be monitored to check the benchmark
is not impacted by some external activity.</li>
<li>Some configurations (desktops and laptops for sure, some servers as well)
have a variable CPU core frequency mechanism. The policy controlling this
mechanism can be set at the OS level. Some CPU models are more aggressive than
others at adapting the frequency of the CPU cores to the workload. To get
reproducible results, it is better to set the highest possible fixed frequency
for all the CPU cores involved in the benchmark.</li>
<li>An important point is to size the system accordingly to the benchmark.
The system must have enough RAM and must not swap. On Linux, do not forget
to set the overcommit_memory parameter correctly. Please note 32 and 64 bits
Redis instances have not the same memory footprint.</li>
<li>If you plan to use RDB or AOF for your benchmark, please check there is no other
I/O activity in the system. Avoid putting RDB or AOF files on NAS or NFS shares,
or on any other devices impacting your network bandwidth and/or latency
(for instance, EBS on Amazon EC2).</li>
<li>Set Redis logging level (loglevel parameter) to warning or notice. Avoid putting
the generated log file on a remote filesystem.</li>
<li>Avoid using monitoring tools which can alter the result of the benchmark. For
instance using INFO at regular interval to gather statistics is probably fine,
but MONITOR will impact the measured performance significantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes: changing the payload from 256 to 1024 or 4096 bytes does not change the
numbers significantly (but reply packets are glued together up to 1024 bytes so
GETs may be slower with big payloads). The same for the number of clients, from
50 to 256 clients I got the same numbers. With only 10 clients it starts to get
a bit slower.</p>
